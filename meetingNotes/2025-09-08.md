# All contributors meeting

## Check in:

Who are you (name/pronouns) and how are you doing today?

- Danny (they/them) (DG) / bit tired, but excited to see this project getting back up and going!
- Lucas(he/him) / doing well, also looking forward to seeing where this goes!

## Our relationship to the project

- Danny works on [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), which uses all-contributors heavily, the team there [has been worried about the lack of activity on all-contributors](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4245) for a little while, and keen to see if we can help out.

- Lucas uses all-contributors in https://github.com/data-apis/array-api-extra and is interested in seeing all-contributors restored to its former glory

## Next steps

- Keen to have another meeting with folks from upstream
- ~~Work is currently happening on getting the docs back online~~, edit: the docs are back online! :tada: 
    - by transferring to github pages
        - this seems to have broken the multilingual functionality though:
            - compare https://web.archive.org/web/20250122060728/https://allcontributors.org/docs/de/bot/overview to https://allcontributors.org/docs/de/bot/overview (the latter 404s)
    - this presumably means that we have DNS access (? when? how?) - does this mean we also have Netlify access (in which case we could see how multi-language was previously supported)

## Priorities

Project can be split into core (incl. docs) and bot.
Current goal, get the core/docs back up and running (with some sort of active maintainers team).
Leave the bot for later (is it currently functional?)

## Capacity/skills/interests?

Lucas:
- skillset: python/rust (not javascript)
- capacity: no promisable bandwidth (heading back to university soon)
- interests: interested in helping push things forward where I can find the time and have relevant knowledge

Danny: 
- skills: lots of bits and bobs!
- capacity: medium!
- interests: getting it working
